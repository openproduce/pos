A few external dependencies live in third_party/.

- big.js for decimal arithmetic used in price display.
- QUnit for unit testing and sinon.js for mocks.
- nodejs and restify for the test server. To run it,

    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
    npm install restify
    node test-server.js

- resty, a small shell script for manual testing.
