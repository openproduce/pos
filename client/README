This is a cash register app for the open produce POS written in plain
Javascript (no frameworks).

It should work in any modern browser but has only been tested in Google Chrome.
To use it, start up a test server and open index.html. You can run unit tests
by opening test.html.

The code mostly follows the model-view-controller pattern. Models live in
models.js, views in the views/ directory and controllers in ctrl/. The
top-level directory also contains generic utilities like magstripe decoding,
key event and XMLHttpRequest wrappers.

A few external dependencies live in third_party/.

- big.js for decimal arithmetic used in price display.
- QUnit for unit testing and sinon.js for mocks.
- nodejs and restify for the test server. To run it,

    sudo apt-get install nodejs npm
    npm install restify
    node test-server.js

- resty, a small shell script for manual testing.
